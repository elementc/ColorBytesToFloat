# Byte to UIColor

Quick tool I (and my best friend from high school, Casey Doran) built to move a giant color pallete from RBG docs to UIColor snippets.

Your lovely designers finished up designs and sent the team the new offical color pallete in tons of RGB or hexadecimal format.
Now you want to turn those into Swift UIColors. Quickly the values, and it will return the UIColor() string and paste it automatically to your clipboard (you can turn that off but it's useful if you want to not use a mouse)

Simple terminal tool to do just that!
 - Byte to float
 - RGB to UIColor
 - RGBA to UIColor
 - HEX to UIColor

Grab the entire xcode project if you like or

Clone the repo OR just grab the terminal app here http://www.johannmg.com/downloads/ColorBytesToFloat
